        I was born just two years after JavaScript was created, in a place where
        boys chose to play with Python and Java instead of attending school,
        finding freedom in those programming languages.

        I remember, my mom would tell me bedtime stories about a future where
        brain chips and robots transform our lives for the better. These tales
        sparked my fascination with technology, although my journey to learn
        programming took a few twists and turns.

        During my Philosophy degree, I studied Logic and deduced that the best
        approach to live a happy life is to think a lot and question everything,
        while following your passion. Later, in my Law Master's program, I wrote
        a dissertation on how brain chip technology, similar to Neuralink's
        work, could impact the legal field.

        After completing my studies, I spent six months in recruitment, helping
        software companies build their engineering teams. There is nothing
        surprising in that I found myself being incredibly interested in the
        technologies my DevOps Engineers and Java Developers used. Talking to IT
        professionals every day made me realize it was time to dive into
        programming.

        In February 2023, I left recruitment and focused on learning Front-End
        development. The very process of coding, styling and looking at the
        visual results of my work brought me immense joy and filled me with all
        the required energy to keep going.

        As of now, I'm chosing to start my tech career as a UI/UX Designer
        because I've got all it takes. I love finding solutions that help
        others, and have a knack for both design and coding. Besides, Iâ€™ve got
        experience in effective communication with different people, coming from
        working in recruitment and studying Philosophy.

        Outside of work, I'm an avid gamer. Games like World of War Craft 3 and
        The Binding of Isaac have captured my attention for hours on end. My
        dream is to create a popular game one day that would teach people to
        think critically and find their meaning in life.
